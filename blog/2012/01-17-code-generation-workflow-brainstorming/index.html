        <p>
          Since starting work at
          <a href="http://pebblecode.com/">Pebble {code}</a> one of the exciting
          new areas that I’ve been looking into is
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_programming"
            >code generation (or automatic programming)</a
          >. The use case is simply auto-generating the bulk of database access
          code directly from the database model its self allowing quicker
          changes to the core model as you’re not having to re-write database
          access code along with every model change. This also allows for a
          higher level of abstraction, therefore allowing higher productivity
          with less code to directly maintain.
        </p>

        <p>
          The current code generation approach we’re using is based around the
          open source
          <a href="http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com/">MyGeneration</a> tool.
          For the design of the model we’re using
          <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/">MySQL workbench</a>
          for modelling the database. For the database interaction we’re using
          the
          <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mybatisnet/"
            >Apache iBatis project</a
          >
          for database mapping.
        </p>

        <p>
          The current workflow for making a change to the model goes something
          like this:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Create table(s) in the MySql workbench model</li>
          <li>
            Export updated create script
            <ol>
              <li>
                Also create any migration scripts required to update the
                existing database with your changes
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Re-create your local development database with the changes</li>
          <li>Open MyGeneration and add any required metadata</li>
          <li>Select the tables and objects you want to re-generate</li>
          <li>Execute code generation</li>
          <li>Perform required manual integration of the generated code</li>
          <li>
            Add any additional handmade code to compliment the generated code
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This current workflow can introduce friction to integration in two
          main areas: 1. Generating code off the local database does not ensure
          that the database has the latest set of changes, or is even generated
          from the current branch of development. Re-deployment of the database
          can also be a time-consuming process if it’s having to be run multiple
          times. 2. The MyGeneration tool has a single install path and is
          therefore a shared component, not specific to the current branch of
          development or included alongside the source control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, my current ideas around this area are to research the
          feasibility of two main changes.
        </p>

        <h2>Remove deployment to an actual database before generating code</h2>

        <p>
          The ideal solution here would be to have a method of extracting the
          database metadata from as close to the original model as possible. A
          good point of interception could be the SQL database create script.
          Theoretically it could be possible to work directly with the workbench
          files, however these are far less stable in standardisation than SQL
          and would be more likely to change and require more on-going work,
          whereas the SQL syntax is very strictly defined.
        </p>

        <p>
          My current research in this area is to use
          <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> to parse the
          <a href="http://www.antlr.org/grammar/1242202695031/mysql-grammar.zip"
            >MySQL grammar</a
          >
          (zip file), and create an object model to represent the created
          database. Initially this would just be supporting table creation
          statements, but could theoretically also extend to views and stored
          procedures. A good example of the object model is the
          <a
            href="http://mygeneration.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mygeneration/trunk/mymeta/Interfaces/"
            >interfaces</a
          >
          used in the
          <a
            href="http://mygeneration.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mygeneration/trunk/mymeta/"
            >MyMeta project</a
          >
          of MyGeneration.
        </p>

        <h2>Integrate code generation into the IDE</h2>

        <p>
          I’m looking specifically at the
          <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx"
            >T4 Text Templates</a
          >. This tool is specifically quite useful as it has tight integration
          with Visual Studio (and other .Net IDEs) as well as being able to be
          run on the
          <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126245.aspx"
            >command line directly</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          The T4 engine is designed specifically to create a single output file
          off of a single template but can also be adapted to
          <a
            href="http://www.olegsych.com/2008/03/how-to-generate-multiple-outputs-from-single-t4-template/"
            >generate multiples files</a
          >. Using the MyGeneration tool to generate multiple files also uses a
          similar technique. This would therefore mean that there is a single
          control template which gets the input model using the previous
          technique, then runs all the sub-templates to create the files in the
          correct locations.
