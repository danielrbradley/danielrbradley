        <p>
          Just a quick post having pushed a new project up to
          <a href="https://github.com/danielrbradley/FluentMySQL"
            >GitHub called FluentMySQL</a
          >, hereâ€™s a quick intro:
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          This is framework, hoping to solve a very specific problem: building
          SQL statements which are easy to validate, refactor and help maximise
          re-use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before coming to write this framework, my experience has been with
          working with in-house database (leaky) abstraction layers,
          hand-writing SQL builders within frameworks and also the
          <a href="http://www.mybatis.org/">mybatis</a> (previously
          <a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/">Apache iBatis</a>). This project
          has therefore come out of wanting to have the control of writing pure
          SQL but with the separation and modularity of writing SQL in a
          framework such as iBatis.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can foresee that this project could be useful both as a standalone
          framework to generate SQL to run manually, but also as a feeder into a
          project to wrap up the execution and mapping of result sets to
          objects.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Principals</h2>

        <p>
          Consistency: The feature-set and design should aim to be one-to-one
          with the MySQL grammar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Specific: Want to solve a fairly narrow problem, but solve it well. If
          this works well, then hopefully the same principals could be applied
          for other such grammars or frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Immutability: A single query object should not be able to be modified;
          rather, new copies should be produced on each modification. This makes
          the approach more akin to that of functional programming (and F# was
          also a serious consideration for this project).
