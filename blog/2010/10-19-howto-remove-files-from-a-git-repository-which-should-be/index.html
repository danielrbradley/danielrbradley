        In the last year or so I’ve discovered the wonders of GIT for managing
        source code and we’ve now moved the majority of our live code base in to
        repositories at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as with most learning curves, you make some mistakes at first.
        One thing that’s been really bugging me is that I didn’t know about the
        ".gitignore" file when creating my first few repositories. This means
        that all the binary files were also initially added. As soon as I learnt
        about the ignore file I went back and added it. Problem is, the git
        ignore file only limits finding new files to add, if the file is already
        being tracked then the ignore file has no effect. Have tried to find
        solutions, but most of the stuff seems to refer to "filter-branch" which
        to be honest I don’t fully understand.
      </p>
      <p>So, here’s my:</p>
      <h2>
        Super Simple Method of Removing Files/Folders that should be ignored
      </h2>
      <p>Example: you wanted to ignore the "bin" folder from your project.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure you have the correct line in your git ignore: e.g.
          <br />
          [Bb]in*/<br />
          (This will match any folder starting with the word "Bin" or "bin")
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the file or folder that’s currently being tracked to somewhere
          that it won’t get committed.<br />
          Either move it out of the folder completely (we’ll put it back later)
          or just rename it to something else that will get ignored e.g.
          renaming "bin" to "bin_" would work for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Commit the changes (check it contains removes for each of the files
          you should be ignoring, perhaps the updated ".gitignore" file, but
          make sure it isn’t re-adding the files from your temporary directory
          or filename!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Now simply rename your files or folders back and now it won’t be
          appearing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Perhaps there’s some kind of smarter way of doing this, but I just find
        this method really easy to understand! It certainly made my day when I
        finally got rid of these files!
